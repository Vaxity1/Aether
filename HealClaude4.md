# Heal.md - Advanced Error Handling, Logging & Deep Learning Tool for Python

**Version**: 1.0  
**Target**: GPT-4.1 AI Agent in Visual Studio Code  
**Execution Trigger**: Automatic upon instructions file load or when substantial code changes are detected

---

## Auto-Execution Condition

**Critical**: If 20 or more code modifications, repairs, or structural changes are made to any Python script within a single prompt session, Heal.md will automatically execute at the completion of all other tasks for that prompt. This ensures immediate quality assurance and prevents error accumulation in heavily modified codebases.
