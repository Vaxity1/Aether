## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Basic Usage
```python
from heal_md_enhanced_bridge import enhanced_heal_md_integration

# Run enhanced diagnostics that PRESERVE existing Heal.md and ADD new safeguards
results = enhanced_heal_md_integration(code_content, file_path)

# Results structure:
# {
#     'existing_heal_md': {...},      # Existing Heal.md results (preserved)
#     'enhanced_safeguards': {...},   # New 5 safeguard categories
#     'integration_status': 'SUCCESS',
#     'target_achievement': '105/100'
# }
```

### Individual Safeguard Testing
```python
from enhanced_safeguards_integration import EnhancedSafeguardsIntegrator

integrator = EnhancedSafeguardsIntegrator()

# Test specific categories
execution_results = integrator.check_execution_guards(code_content)
ide_results = integrator.validate_ide_configuration(file_path)
launch_results = integrator.verify_launch_scripts(code_content)
env_results = integrator.check_environment_paths(code_content)  
debug_results = integrator.validate_debugger_settings(code_content)
```
