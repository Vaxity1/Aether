# AI Instruction Template Evaluation Framework (AITEF)
## Version 1.0 - World Standard Assessment Protocol

## Overview

The AI Instruction Template Evaluation Framework (AITEF) is a comprehensive, standardized methodology for assessing AI instruction templates across five critical domains. This framework provides objective, quantifiable metrics to evaluate template quality, effectiveness, and potential for real-world implementation.

**Purpose:** To establish a world-standard benchmark for AI instruction template evaluation, enabling consistent assessment and improvement of AI agent instructions across different contexts and applications.

**Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Evaluates templates across 5 weighted domains covering structural, technical, practical, innovative, and performance aspects
- **Quantifiable Scoring**: Uses a 100-point scale with detailed scoring rubrics for objective evaluation
- **Standardized Methodology**: Provides consistent evaluation criteria that can be applied across different template types and use cases
- **Actionable Insights**: Generates detailed feedback and improvement recommendations for template enhancement

**Evaluation Domains:**
1. **Structural Integrity (20%)** - Organization, completeness, consistency, scalability
2. **Technical Sophistication (25%)** - Advanced methodologies, self-improvement, memory/learning, integration
3. **Practical Utility (20%)** - Implementation feasibility, resource efficiency, error handling, user experience
4. **Innovation & Adaptability (15%)** - Creative problem-solving, flexibility, future-proofing, emergent capabilities
5. **Performance & Effectiveness (20%)** - Goal achievement, measurability, optimization, validation

**Quick Start Command:** Use "TestNow" with any attached .md file to automatically initiate AITEF evaluation of that template according to this framework's grading system.

## TestNow Command Instructions

**Command Usage:** "TestNow" + attached .md file

When you use "TestNow" with an attached .md file (or reference one in the context), this triggers automatic evaluation of that template using the AITEF framework. The evaluation will:

1. **Automatically analyze** the attached template across all 5 domains
2. **Assign scores** based on the detailed rubrics provided in this framework
3. **Generate a complete evaluation report** with scores, rationale, and recommendations
4. **Provide actionable feedback** for template improvement

**Example Usage:**
- "TestNow [attach your template.md]"
- "TestNow - evaluate the template I just uploaded"
- "Use TestNow to assess this instruction template"

The TestNow command transforms this template into an active evaluation tool, automatically applying the AITEF methodology to assess any AI instruction template you provide.
