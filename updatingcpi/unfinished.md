## Sequential Prompt System Integration

### Agent Command System
- **"NEXT!" Command**: Delivers exactly 5 prompts at a time from the sequential list
- **Never repeat prompts**: Agent tracks completed prompts and never goes backward unless code was deleted/missing
- **Priority Recovery**: If previous code sections were deleted, edited, or are missing, those prompts get prioritized within the current 5-prompt execution

### Execution Flow on "NEXT!" Command
On every "NEXT!" command, the agent must execute in this exact order:
1. **Review and fix errors first** - Scan for any syntax errors, runtime issues, or broken functionality
2. **Refactor existing code** - Improve structure, efficiency, and maintainability
3. **Add three features** - Implement backend logic + frontend interface for each feature
4. **Complete any user request** - Address specific user requirements or modifications
5. **Refactor again** - Final cleanup and optimization pass
6. **Log all errors and session results** - Document what was completed, issues found, and status

### Prompt Tracking System
- Agent maintains internal counter of completed prompts (1-500)
- Each "NEXT!" execution advances counter by 5
- If code restoration is needed, those prompts take priority within current batch
- Agent reports current progress: "Executing prompts [X-Y] of 500"

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Auto-Healing Protocol

**CRITICAL AUTO-TRIGGER**: When any single prompt execution results in 20+ modifications, changes, or alterations:

1. ✅ Complete ALL requested tasks from the current prompt first
2. 🔄 THEN automatically reference and execute Heal.md protocols
3. 📊 Log the trigger event with timestamp and change count
4. 🛡️ Perform Heal.md diagnostics, validation, and cleanup procedures
5. 📋 Report healing results before marking the prompt as complete

### Automatic Quality Assurance Protocol

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS** - Execute Heal.md when ANY of the following occur in a single prompt:

- 20+ code modifications (additions, deletions, changes)
- 20+ file operations (create, rename, move, delete)
- Changes to critical system files or configurations
- Dependency modifications or additions
- Database schema alterations
- API endpoint modifications
- Multiple component/module changes

**EXECUTION SEQUENCE**:

1. ✅ Complete all user-requested tasks from current prompt
2. 🔄 Auto-invoke Heal.md protocols (load Heal.md and execute all procedures)
3. 📊 Generate change impact report
4. 🛡️ Execute Heal.md diagnostics, validation, and cleanup
5. 📋 Report healing results before marking prompt complete

**CHANGE TRACKING** - Count these as modifications:

- Code additions, deletions, modifications
- File creation, deletion, renaming, moving
- Configuration changes
- Import/export statement changes
- Function/method additions or modifications
- Variable declarations or changes
- Comment additions (if substantial)

**OVERRIDE COMMANDS**:

- Manual trigger: "heal!" command
- Skip auto-trigger: "skip-heal!" command (use cautiously)
- Force heal: "force-heal!" command (regardless of change count)

### Automated Validation Pipeline

1. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Syntax validation with real-time error detection
   - Style compliance with automated formatting
   - Performance profiling with bottleneck identification
   - Security scanning with vulnerability assessment

2. **Functional Testing**

   - Integration tests for system-wide functionality
   - End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
   - Performance tests for scalability and responsiveness

3. **User Experience Validation**
   - Accessibility compliance with WCAG guidelines
   - Usability testing with real user scenarios
   - Performance benchmarking with response time metrics
   - Error handling validation with edge case testing

    # Learning bonus for new patterns
    learning_bonus = 1.0
    if task.introduces_new_pattern:
        learning_bonus = 1.3
    
    # Sequential prompt priority
    prompt_priority = 1.0
    if task.is_sequential_prompt:

# Python Refactoring & Error Correction Protocol

## Pre-Completion Mandatory Review
**EXECUTE BEFORE FINALIZING ANY PYTHON DELIVERABLE**

### 1. Python-Specific Code Analysis
- **Syntax Validation**: Check for SyntaxError, IndentationError, and TabError
- **Type Checking**: Validate type hints, duck typing, and None handling
- **Import Management**: Verify import statements, circular imports, and unused imports
- **Python Idioms**: Ensure Pythonic patterns (list comprehensions, context managers, generators)
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Use appropriate built-in exceptions (ValueError, TypeError, KeyError)

### 2. Performance & Memory Optimization
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Identify O(n²) loops, inefficient data structures
- **Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks, large object retention, generator usage
- **Built-in Functions**: Leverage `map()`, `filter()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()` where appropriate
- **String Operations**: Use f-strings, avoid repeated concatenation
- **Data Structures**: Optimize dict/set lookups vs list iterations

### 3. Python Standards Compliance
- **PEP 8**: Line length (79 chars), naming conventions, whitespace
- **PEP 257**: Docstring format
