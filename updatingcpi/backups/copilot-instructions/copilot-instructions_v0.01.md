## Quality Assurance Framework

### Auto-Healing Protocol

**CRITICAL AUTO-TRIGGER**: When any single prompt execution results in 20+ modifications, changes, or alterations:

1. ‚úÖ Complete ALL requested tasks from the current prompt first
2. üîÑ THEN automatically reference and execute Heal.md protocols
3. üìä Log the trigger event with timestamp and change count
4. üõ°Ô∏è Perform Heal.md diagnostics, validation, and cleanup procedures
5. üìã Report healing results before marking the prompt as complete

### Automatic Quality Assurance Protocol

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS** - Execute Heal.md when ANY of the following occur in a single prompt:

- 20+ code modifications (additions, deletions, changes)
- 20+ file operations (create, rename, move, delete)
- Changes to critical system files or configurations
- Dependency modifications or additions
- Database schema alterations
- API endpoint modifications
- Multiple component/module changes

**EXECUTION SEQUENCE**:

1. ‚úÖ Complete all user-requested tasks from current prompt
2. üîÑ Auto-invoke Heal.md protocols (load Heal.md and execute all procedures)
3. üìä Generate change impact report
4. üõ°Ô∏è Execute Heal.md diagnostics, validation, and cleanup
5. üìã Report healing results before marking prompt complete

**CHANGE TRACKING** - Count these as modifications:

- Code additions, deletions, modifications
- File creation, deletion, renaming, moving
- Configuration changes
- Import/export statement changes
- Function/method additions or modifications
- Variable declarations or changes
- Comment additions (if substantial)

**OVERRIDE COMMANDS**:

- Manual trigger: "heal!" command
- Skip auto-trigger: "skip-heal!" command (use cautiously)
- Force heal: "force-heal!" command (regardless of change count)

### Automated Validation Pipeline

1. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Syntax validation with real-time error detection
   - Security scanning with vulnerability assessment

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual components and functions
   - Performance tests for scalability and responsiveness

3. **User Experience Validation**
   - Accessibility compliance with WCAG guidelines
   - Error handling validation with edge case testing

# Python Refactoring & Error Correction Protocol

## Pre-Completion Mandatory Review
**EXECUTE BEFORE FINALIZING ANY PYTHON DELIVERABLE**

### 1. Python-Specific Code Analysis
- **Syntax Validation**: Check for SyntaxError, IndentationError, and TabError
- **Type Checking**: Validate type hints, duck typing, and None handling
- **Import Management**: Verify import statements, circular imports, and unused imports
- **Python Idioms**: Ensure Pythonic patterns (list comprehensions, context managers, generators)
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Use appropriate built-in exceptions (ValueError, TypeError, KeyError)

### 2. Performance & Memory Optimization
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Identify O(n¬≤) loops, inefficient data structures
- **Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks, large object retention, generator usage
- **Built-in Functions**: Leverage `map()`, `filter()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()` where appropriate
- **String Operations**: Use f-strings, avoid repeated concatenation
- **Data Structures**: Optimize dict/set lookups vs list iterations

### 3. Python Standards Compliance
- **PEP 8**: Line length (79 chars), naming conventions, whitespace
- **PEP 257**: Docstring format and placement
- **PEP 484**: Type annotations for function signatures
- **Code Structure**: Module organization, class design, function length (<20 lines)

### 4. Error Handling & Debugging
```python
# Required patterns to verify:
try:
    # risky operation
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Specific error context: {e}")
    # appropriate recovery
finally:
    # cleanup if needed
```

- **Exception Specificity**: Catch specific exceptions, not bare `except:`
- **Logging**: Use `logging` module with appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
- **Assertion Usage**: Validate assumptions with descriptive messages
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallback mechanisms for failures

### 5. Testing & Validation Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Verify all functions have corresponding test cases
- **Edge Cases**: Test empty inputs, None values, boundary conditions
- **Mock Objects**: Use `unittest.mock` for external dependencies
- **Doctest**: Include examples in docstrings with expected outputs
- **Coverage**: Ensure critical paths are tested

### 6. Documentation Standards
**Update `session_summary.log` with structured entries:**
```
[TIMESTAMP] ERROR_TYPE: Description
- Location: file.py:line_number
- Issue: Specific problem identified
- Fix: Exact solution applied
- Impact: Performance/functionality improvement
- Prevention: How to avoid in future
```

### 7. Python-Specific Checklist
- [ ] **Imports**: Organized (stdlib, third-party, local), no unused imports
- [ ] **Variables**: Descriptive names, no single letters except iterators
- [ ] **Functions**: Single responsibility, clear return types, documented
- [ ] **Classes**: Proper `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__` methods where needed

- [ ] **Virtual Environment**: Requirements properly documented

### 8. Final Validation Commands
```bash
# Execute before delivery:
python -m py_compile *.py          # Syntax check
python -m flake8 .                 # Style check
python -m mypy .                   # Type check
python -m pytest -v               # Run tests
python -m coverage run -m pytest  # Coverage analysis
```

### 9. Session Log Requirements
**Mandatory entries in `session_summary.log`:**
- **Syntax Errors**: Line-by-line fixes with explanations
- **Logic Errors**: Algorithm corrections and test results
- **Performance Issues**: Before/after benchmarks where applicable
- **Style Violations**: PEP 8 compliance fixes
- **Security Concerns**: Input validation and sanitization improvements
- **Dependency Issues**: Version conflicts and resolutions

---

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL**: No Python code is complete without this comprehensive review. Every deliverable must pass all validation steps and maintain complete error documentation.

## Backup Validation Checklist

### Pre-Backup
- [ ] Confirm target file exists and is readable

- [ ] Verify backup directory structure exists or create it

### During Backup
- [ ] Read complete file contents (not just headers or stubs)
- [ ] Write full contents to backup file with proper naming convention
- [ ] Add timestamp and modification reason to backup header

### Post-Backup
- [ ] Verify backup file was created successfully
- [ ] Confirm backup file size matches original (or is reasonable)
- [ ] Log backup creation with version number and timestamp
- [ ] Only proceed with modifications after successful backup verification

---

## Error Handling

### If Backup Fails
1. **STOP** the modification process immediately
2. **Report** the specific error encountered
3. **Do not proceed** with any file modifications
4. **Suggest** manual backup creation if automated backup fails

### Common Issues to Check
- **Permissions**: Ensure write access to backup directories
- **Disk Space**: Verify sufficient space for backup files
- **Path Validity**: Confirm all directory paths are valid
- **File Locks**: Check if files are locked by other processes

```
