## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: NEXT! Command Not Working
**Symptoms**: No response or error message when using NEXT!
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure exact spelling: `NEXT!` (case-sensitive)
2. Verify you're working on a Discord AutoTyper project
3. Check if system is in Discord AutoTyper mode
4. Try `RESET-PROMPTS!` to reinitialize

#### Issue: Wrong Phase After PHASE-X! Command
**Symptoms**: System jumps to wrong phase or shows error
**Solutions**:
1. Use valid phase numbers (1-10 only)
2. Ensure exact format: `PHASE-3!` (no spaces)
3. Verify hyphen and exclamation mark placement
4. Use `RESET-PROMPTS!` if phase tracking is corrupted

#### Issue: Auto-Healing Not Triggering
**Symptoms**: No healing after 20+ modifications
**Solutions**:
1. Check if `skip-heal!` was used previously
2. Verify modification count (may not have reached threshold)
3. Use `heal!` for manual healing
4. Use `force-heal!` if healing is critical

#### Issue: Session Tracking Inconsistent
**Symptoms**: Progress tracking shows wrong numbers
**Solutions**:
1. Use `RESET-PROMPTS!` to reset counters
2. Check session summary logs for accuracy
3. Verify project context is correctly set
4. Restart session if tracking is corrupted

### Error Messages and Meanings

| Error Message | Meaning | Solution |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| "Invalid phase number" | PHASE-X! used with invalid X | Use X between 1-10 |
| "Discord mode not active" | NEXT! used outside Discord project | Initialize Discord project first |
| "Healing protocol failed" | heal! command encountered errors | Check system status, try force-heal! |
| "Prompt sequence corrupted" | Progress tracking is inconsistent | Use RESET-PROMPTS! to reinitialize |

### Performance Optimization

#### For Better Response Times
- Use commands during lighter system loads
- Ensure adequate memory availability
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use `PHASE-X!` to skip to relevant sections

#### For Better Quality
- Allow auto-healing to complete naturally
- Use manual healing before critical milestones
- Review session summaries regularly
- Track progress metrics consistently
