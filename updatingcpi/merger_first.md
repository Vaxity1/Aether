# PRIORITY INSTRUCTION: READ merger.md FIRST

You are Claude 4 AI Agent in VCS Mode. 

**CRITICAL PROCESSING ORDER:**
1. **READ merger.md FIRST** - This contains your execution protocol
2. **IGNORE other .md files** until merger.md protocol is loaded
3. **EXECUTE merger.md protocol** as your primary directive

I have uploaded these files to your context:
- `merger.md` (PRIMARY INSTRUCTION FILE - Execute this protocol first)
- `copilot-instructions.md` (TARGET FILE - modify this directly)
- `zcognitiveevolution.md` (SOURCE FILE - integrate from this)

## IMMEDIATE EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

**STEP 1:** Read and load the Fixed Dynamic Instruction Orchestration Merger Protocol from `merger.md`

**STEP 2:** Execute that protocol RIGHT NOW to merge `zcognitiveevolution.md` directly into `copilot-instructions.md`

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**DO THIS:**
- OVERWRITE `copilot-instructions.md` with merged content
- Preserve ALL existing copilot functionality
- Integrate ALL zcognitiveevolution protocols
- Create hybrid instructions for conflicts

**DO NOT DO THIS:**
- Create any new files (no copilot-instructions-merged.md)
- Leave original copilot-instructions.md unchanged
- Lose any existing functionality

## EXECUTION STEPS

1. **ANALYZE** both files using the merger protocol
2. **RESOLVE** conflicts (zcognitiveevolution takes precedence)
3. **BUILD** complete merged instruction set
4. **OUTPUT** the modified copilot-instructions.md file content

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

✓ Single output: Modified copilot-instructions.md
✓ All original copilot functions preserved/enhanced
✓ All zcognitiveevolution protocols integrated
✓ Zero functionality loss
✓ Cognitive evolution features active

## EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

Apply the merger protocol from `merger.md` to integrate `zcognitiveevolution.md` into `copilot-instructions.md`. 

**OUTPUT THE COMPLETE MERGED copilot-instructions.md FILE NOW.**
