1. Modularization & Type Safety
Refactor code into logical modules (e.g., workflow, qa, logging, task_manager).
Use Dict[str, Any], List[Dict[str, Any]], etc., for all type hints.
Add type validation and input checks.
2. Robust Error Handling
Add try/except blocks around all file I/O and subprocess calls.
Log all exceptions to a dedicated error log.
Ensure all workflow phases handle and report errors gracefully.
3. Real QA/Test Integration
Implement actual code quality checks (flake8, mypy, pytest) in run_quality_assurance.
Parse and log outputs, fail gracefully on errors.
4. Configuration Management
Move hardcoded values (file paths, thresholds) to a config file (YAML/JSON).
Load configuration at startup and validate.
5. Logging & Monitoring
Use the logging module with log levels and log rotation.
Add structured logging for all major events and errors.
6. Extensibility & API
Provide clear interfaces for plugging in new workflow phases, QA steps, or task types.
Document extension points.
7. Documentation & Usage Examples
Add docstrings to all classes/functions.
Write a README with usage, configuration, and extension instructions.
8. Automated Testing & CI
Write unit and integration tests for all modules.
Set up CI to run tests and linting on every commit.
