# Discord Automation GUI

A project that started out as a feature-rich Discord message automation tool with a modern graphical user interface that turned into
a glorious dopamine rushed dance to get a autonomous AI Agent thats capable of self-repair, self-diagnosis, learning from past
conversations, projects, failed code, failed terminal entries, etc.  This project for me has turned into a beautiful thing 
where superior prompting techniques have lead to a plausible Autonomous AI Agent Template that is constantly improving itself, testing
itself, tracking its own learning rate, etc.

More to come!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Windows Explorer (Easiest)
1. Double-click `launch.bat` in Windows Explorer
2. The launcher will automatically check dependencies and start the GUI

### Option 2: Python Launcher
1. Run `python launcher.py` from command line
2. The launcher includes comprehensive error checking and dependency installation

### Option 3: Direct Execution
1. Run `python main.py` from command line
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed first

### Option 4: VS Code
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Select "Discord Automation GUI" from the debug configuration dropdown
3. Press F5 to launch with debugging
